      <p>
        Clara was born on September 18, 1819 in Leipzig, Germany. By the age of 5
         she was a child prodigy and toured Paris before her teen years. In 1840 against
          her father’s wishes Clara married her husband, Robert Schumann. At the time
          Robert was an unknown composer. Clara and Robert had eight children between 1841 and
          1854. Clara worked to help circulate and managed her husband’s works and encouraged
          her husband to write his Piano Concerto, which she premiered and played often. Robert
           encouraged his wife’s work. Clara stopped composing after Robert’s death in 1865.
